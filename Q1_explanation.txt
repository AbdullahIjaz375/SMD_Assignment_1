The issue with having one class inherit properties from two distinct classes is that if there is the same function in both classes, the inheritting class will not know which one to call which is famously called the Diamond Inheritance Problem.Java provides a solution to the multiple inheritance problem through interfaces. While a class can inherit from only one superclass, it can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces allow classes to define contracts for behavior without providing concrete implementations.
